<h1><b><u> Gas Sensor: </u> </b></h1>
<p>A gas sensor is a device which detects the presence or concentration of gases in the atmosphere. Based on the concentration of the gas the sensor produces a 
corresponding potential difference by changing the resistance of the material inside the sensor, which can be measured as output voltage. Based on this voltage value 
the type and concentration of the gas can be estimated.The type of gas the sensor could detect depends on the sensing material present inside the sensor.
 Normally these sensors are available as modules with comparators as shown above. These comparators can be set for a particular threshold value of gas concentration.
 When the concentration of the gas exceeds this threshold the digital pin goes high. The analog pin can be used to measure the concentration of the gas.</p>

<p> Types
Gas detectors can be classified according to the operation mechanism (semiconductors, oxidation, catalytic, photoionization, infrared, etc.). 
Gas detectors come packaged into two main form factors: portable devices and fixed gas detectors.

Portable detectors are used to monitor the atmosphere around personnel and are either hand-held or worn on clothing or on a belt/harness. These gas detectors are 
usually battery operated. They transmit warnings via audible and visible signals, such as alarms and flashing lights, when dangerous levels of gas vapors are detected.

Fixed type gas detectors may be used for detection of one or more gas types. Fixed type detectors are generally mounted near the process area of a plant or
 control room, or an area to be protected, such as a residential bedroom. Generally, industrial sensors are installed on fixed type mild steel structures and a cable
 connects the detectors to a SCADA system for continuous monitoring. A tripping interlock an be activated for an emergency situation.</p>
